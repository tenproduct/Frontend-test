## Create an app using Angular and Angular Material to search and display Star Wars characters using [Swapi](https://swapi.dev/)

![Mock Up design](https://i.imgur.com/RA0lZtYg.png, "Mock Up design")

## Requirements
- [ ] On page load display all characters returned from the endpoint `https://swapi.dev/api/people/`
  - [x] Display the visible amount shown and the max result count
- [ ] Add a material select so the user can sort the results by:
  - [ ] A-Z
  - [ ] Z-A
  - [ ] Male
  - [ ] Female
- [x] On each card in the results include an image `assets/mock-image.png` and display the character name below as shown in the design. 
  - [x] For every odd card use image `assets/mock-image-1.png`
- [x] When the user clicks load more it should append the next set of results
- [ ] When a user types a character name and clicks search, it should call `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=` and update the results.
- [ ] The page should be responsive, ensure the layout looks respectable on mobile and tablet viewpoints.
- [ ] Unit tests will be a big bonus point.

## What we will evaluate
- [ ] Your code will be evaluated by: semantics, structure, legibility, size, among other factors.
- [ ] The git history will be evaluated.
- [x] Our tech stack here is Angular 9, NGRX, SCSS and Angular Material, we would like you to use the same stack.
- [ ] We're looking for a front-end developer who knows how to build layouts and knows a lot about JavaScript. Use this as an opportunity to show us how good you are on both areas.
